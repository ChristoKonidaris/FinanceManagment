##Background

With the introduction of services like Uber Eats and Mr Delivery, a new trend has emerged amongst
groups of friends or work colleagues. Members of these groups will usually take turns to order food for
the group daily for the sake of convenience and saving on delivery costs. This works well, however,
keeping track of the financing can become cumbersome with multiple transactions going back and
forth between members.
Write an application that allows a user to keep track of who they owe within the group and who owes
them.

##Core concepts

• Node.js (Backend)
• Vue.js (Frontend)
• PostgreSQL (Database)
• TypeScript (programming language)

##Details

Create a web application that allows a user to log in to their account. The back end should be in the
form of an API:
1. Allow a user to create a group and to set up when a report is generated (weekly or monthly).
2. The user should be able to add an entry for a particular day, inputting the amount that each
member owes them for that day.
3. Similarly, if you owe another user this should be displayed.
4. Generate a report for the group based on the period set up, the report must contain all
transactions for the given period.
5. The report must contain a summary of who owes who and what the total amount is.

##BONUS:

• Add in a notification system that alerts users of new transactions and sends them the report when
ready.

##Extra Information

• Please remember to use inline documentation.
